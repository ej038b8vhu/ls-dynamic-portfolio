# [DYNAMIC-PORTFOLIO](https://dynamic-lecter.netlify.app)

Hi Finn,  
  
This is a small one, but still a good practice though. You adapt new skill, mainly you use:  

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling, very handy.

- [Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for Form setting

- [Form Submit](https://formsubmit.co/) get notice after user submit the form

- VScode extension
  - [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense] for code autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.
  - [Tailwind Documentation] by press (cmd + ctrl + t) to open up tailwind documentation.
